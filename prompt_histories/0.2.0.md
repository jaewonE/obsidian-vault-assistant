Before starting work, familiarize yourself with README.md, AGENTS.md, and CHANGELOGS.md. This task is for version 0.2.0, where the goal is UI/UX improvement.

Requirements:
Currently, Notebooklm also provides answers in speech bubbles. Modify the UI so that Notebooklm's responses are delivered in markdown-formatted text, not speech bubbles, unlike the user's questions. This is similar to ChatGPT and Gemini.

After npm run build completes, copy the main.js, manifest.json, and styles.css files created in the root directory to '/Users/jaewone/Library/ Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/JaewonE/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-vault-assistant'. Remove the data.json file that was in this directory. Add this command to package.json.
