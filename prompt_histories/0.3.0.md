Before starting work, familiarize yourself with README.md, AGENTS.md, and CHANGELOGS.md. This task is for version 0.2.0, where the goal is UI/UX improvement.

We will be working on version 0.3.0, and we plan to fundamentally review and refactor the BM25 algorithm, chat save & load algorithm, and architecture.

The current major issue is as follows:

The BM25 algorithm is not functioning properly. For example, the file "heapsort.md" exists, and within it, "documentation content clearly includes the word 'heapsort' and describes the heapsort algorithm." Therefore, when asked to "explain heapsort," this document should be available through the source code. However, it is not.

Before starting, analyze how the BM25-based document retrieval system works for source exploration and determine why the BM25 algorithm fails to retrieve the appropriate files. While the code cannot be executed for analysis, "no code modifications should be performed." Your response should include your analysis, the suspected cause, and a proposed solution.
