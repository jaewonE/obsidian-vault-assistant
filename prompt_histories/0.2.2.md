Version 0.2.2 will be implemented.

Requirements:
- If a conversation continues within the same tab, **sources used in previous questions must be reused in the current question's answers**. Specifically, record the source-ids for all sources within the same tab and pass these source-ids along with the new question.
- Allow users to directly verify which sources were used for this question. A toggleable text or button at the top of the answer must define a source list area. Each source should be displayed as a document title & extension, e.g., “algorithm.md”. Clicking the source text should open that source in a new Obsidian tab.
